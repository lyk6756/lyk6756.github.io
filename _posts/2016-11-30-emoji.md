# Jemoji: emoji plugin for Jekyll

[Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji), a GitHub-flavored emoji plugin for Jekyll, is an official plugin provided by GitHub to support emoji emoticons on any jekyll pages and GitHub Pages.

It is quite easy to setup jemoji, add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'jemoji'
```

And add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
gems:
  - jemoji
```

# Using emoji

You can add emoji to your writing by typing `:EMOJICODE:`. For example:

```
@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:
```

will render as:

@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:

Typing `:` will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.
